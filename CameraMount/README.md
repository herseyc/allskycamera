# Camera Mount 3D Print Files

STL for the mount holding the SVBONY SV305 in the AllSky Camera enclosure.

305MountPart1.stl and 305MountPart2.stl are the two halves of the original design.  There were no holes in the tabs to mount to the enclosure.  

SV305CameraMount.stl is both sides with holes in tabs to mount it to the enclosure.
